1. **You**: Add tests for the following code: 
```python
marks=56
marks>=35 
```
2. **ChatGPT**: To add tests for the provided code, we want to ensure that we check whether the variable `marks` meets the condition of being greater than or equal to 35. Testing will help us confirm that our code works correctly for different scenarios.

Letâ€™s break down the process step-by-step:

### Step 1: Understand the Code
The current code checks if `marks` (which is set to 56) is greater than or equal to 35. The expression `marks >= 35` evaluates to `True`, but it does not store or print anything.

### Step 2: Refactor the Code for Testing
To make it easier to test, we can refactor this into a function. This will allow us to pass different values of marks easily.

```python
def is_pass(marks):
    return marks >= 35
```

### Step 3: Writing Test Cases
Now let's write some test cases. We'll check a few scenarios:
1. When marks are above 35 (should return `True`).
2. When marks are exactly 35 (should return `True`).
3. When marks are below 35 (should return `False`).

### Step 4: Implementing the Tests
We'll use assertions for testing, which will raise an error if the condition is not met.

Here's how the complete code with tests would look:

```python
def is_pass(marks):
    return marks >= 35

# Test cases
def run_tests():
    # Test when marks are greater than 35
    assert is_pass(56) == True, "Test Case 1 Failed"
    
    # Test when marks are exactly 35
    assert is_pass(35) == True, "Test Case 2 Failed"
    
    # Test when marks are below 35
    assert is_pass(20) == False, "Test Case 3 Failed"
    
    # Test with a negative value
    assert is_pass(-10) == False, "Test Case 4 Failed"

    # Test with zero
    assert is_pass(0) == False, "Test Case 5 Failed"

    print("All test cases passed!")

# Run the tests
run_tests()
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Function Definition**: `is_pass(marks)` checks if marks are >= 35.
2. **Testing Function**: `run_tests()` includes several assertions:
   - One where marks are greater than 35 (should return `True`).
   - One where marks are exactly 35 (should return `True`).
   - One where marks are below 35 (should return `False`).
   - Additional tests for negative numbers and zero to ensure comprehensive coverage.
3. **Assertions**: If any assertion fails, Python will raise an `AssertionError` with the specified message.
4. **Execution**: Finally, we call `run_tests()` to run all our test cases.

### Conclusion
By following these steps, you can effectively test your code. You can add more test cases as needed to cover more scenarios, ensuring your function behaves as expected.
